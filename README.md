## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `src/`: Source code for the application.
  - `assets/`: Static assets.
  - `components/`: Reusable components.
  - `contexts/`: React context for state management.
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
  - `layouts/`: UI layouts.
  - `pages/`: Application pages.
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions.
- `public/`: Static assets.
- `.eslintrc.cjs`: ESLint configuration.
- `index.html`: Entry point for the application.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** For building the user interface.
- **React-hook-form:** For form validation.
- **React Bootstrap:** For styling.
- **React Toastify:** For toast notifications.
- **React Icons:** For icons.
- **Context API:** For managing application state across components.
- **React-Pro-Sidebar:** For sidebar.
- **Chart.js:** For dashboard charts.
- **Framer-motion:** For drag and drop animation.

## Skills and Techniques Covered

- **React Development**: Utilizing functional components, hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`), and `the context API` for state management across the application.

- **Routing and Navigation**: Implemented client-side routing using `react-router-dom` with route protection to manage navigation between different parts of the application.

- **Form Handling and Validation**: Leverageing `react-hook-form` for efficient form handling and validation, ensuring a smooth user experience when submitting data.

- **API Integration**: Used `axios` for making HTTP requests to protected and public endpoints, as seen in the [`apiProtected`](src/utils/api.ts) and [`apiPublic`](src/utils/api.ts) utilities.

- **Custom Hooks**: Showcases the creation and use of `custom hooks` (e.g., [`usePieChartData`](src/hooks/other/usePieChartData.ts)) to encapsulate and reuse logic across components.

- **Error Handling and Notifications**: Implements error handling strategies and user notifications using `react-toastify`, enhancing the user interface and experience.
